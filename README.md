<p style="text-align:center"># Sande10Tweaker</p>
## This is my personal tweaker for tweaking out unnecessary stuff from Windows without breaking any functionality.

For starters, use **Reccomended** stuff _first_(.bat, .ps1 and .reg) as they're not going to interfere or break your system, so, bare minimum of what you should disable. Next, use stuff manually. I hope the names are clear enough.

*Will constantly update with new stuff. Some tweaks are based on [Win10Tweaker(not reccomended to use anymore)](https://win10tweaker.ru/) options as they give them out in the wikinarium, [Winaero Tweaker](https://winaero.com/winaero-tweaker/) and [Ultimate Windows Tweaker 4](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/ultimate-windows-tweaker-4-windows-10). UI version coming someday.
